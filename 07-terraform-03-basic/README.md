## Задача 1. Создадим бэкэнд в S3

Создаем бакет для стейтов:

```
 resource "aws_s3_bucket" "kosmos38_bucket" {
   bucket = "kosmos38-netology-test"
   acl = "private"
 }
```

Создаем бэкенд в S3 для хранения стейтов:

```
terraform {
  backend "s3" {
    bucket = "kosmos38-netology-test"
    key    = "main-infra/terraform.tfstate"
    region = "us-west-2"
  }
}

kosmos@centos:/git/devops-netology/terraform$ terraform init

Initializing the backend...
Do you want to copy existing state to the new backend?
  Pre-existing state was found while migrating the previous "local" backend to the
  newly configured "s3" backend. No existing state was found in the newly
  configured "s3" backend. Do you want to copy this state to the new "s3"
  backend? Enter "yes" to copy and "no" to start with an empty state.

  Enter a value: yes

Successfully configured the backend "s3"! Terraform will automatically
use this backend unless the backend configuration changes.
```

## Задача 2. Инициализируем проект и создаем воркспейсы.

>> Создайте два воркспейса stage и prod

```
kosmos@centos:/git/devops-netology/terraform$ terraform workspace new prod
Created and switched to workspace "prod"!

kosmos@centos:/git/devops-netology/terraform$ terraform workspace new stage
Created and switched to workspace "stage"!
```

>> Вывод команды terraform workspace list.

```
kosmos@centos:/git/devops-netology/terraform$ terraform workspace list
  default
  prod
* stage
```

>> Вывод команды terraform plan для воркспейса prod

	kosmos@centos:/git/devops-netology/terraform$ terraform workspace select prod

```
kosmos@centos:/git/devops-netology/terraform$ terraform plan

Terraform used the selected providers to generate the following execution plan. Resource actions are indicated with the following symbols:
  + create

Terraform will perform the following actions:
